						★★★★★
						<br /><q>Outstanding work, my friend! Yo, we gotta collab on my manuscript with my buddy Christiaan! Asked him already, he's down, and I know you love particle stuff! You don't gotta include that in the review btw, just a genuine question.</q>
						<br />- Nicolas Fatio de Duillier

						★★★★☆
						<br /><q>This had me splitting my sides all the way through! Just wow, this "Newtonian gravity" thing and its inability to explain the orbit of Mercury is just something else, man. The contrast between its formality and idiocy is spectacularly done; at a glace, I never woulda expected it to be a comedy! (It is a comedy, right?)</q>
						<br />- Albert Einstein
