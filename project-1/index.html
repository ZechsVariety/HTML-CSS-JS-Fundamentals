				<h3>THE THEORY OF GRAVITY</h3>

				<p>
					Ever wonder how gravity works? Heck, what even is a "gravity" anyway? <strong>I HAVE THE ANSWERS!!!</strong>
					<br /><br />I, the ever so famous sir Isaac Newton, know things... about gravity. NO ONE ELSE knows what I know, but all that ends today. With my research up for grabs, <em>YOU</em> can be the next genius with incredible knowledge of how jumping is even possible, and stuff like that.
					<br /><br />Imagine... a piano falling right above you. How would you ever survive without the ability to calculate its speed? This research is a life saver!

				<h3>...AND MORE</h3>

				<p> <!--funnily enough, i had no idea isaac newton was responsible for calculus and optics stuff-->
					Of course, like anyone, there's more to me than what meets the eye. Check my Wikipedia, for Christ's sake! I basically invented calculus, discovering the generalized binomial theorem with my own two hands (though that is a horrific simplification of my efforts, but you get it). I even discovered that cool trick everyone knows about: when you shine a white light into a prism, it refracts into a rainbow! It's so cool!
					<br /><br />But alas, the average person only gives a darn about gravity.
					<br /><br />People today only know me for that stupid apple falling on my head; a story that has been blatantly strung and twisted to slander me! An apple hitting my noggin is so egregiously preposterous and I can assure you, I have no memory of it ever happening.
