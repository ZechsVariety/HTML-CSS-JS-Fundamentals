				<h3>ACHIEVEMENTS</h3>

				<p>
					I, Sir Isaac Newton, have dedicated my entire life to my studies. I'm a polymath who's dabbled in a bit of math, physics, astronomy, chemistry and theology. Bet you don't even know what half those things are!
					<br /><br />I'm also a famous award-winning author, my book <em>Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica</em> practically invented classical mechanics. In fact, I practically invented a lot of things. There's a reason why forces are measured in Newtons, you know. Why be humble? I'm the most influencial figure in all of modern science, for Christ's sake!

				<h3>EARLY LIFE</h3>

				<p>
					I was born prematurely on (what was previously) Christmas day in 1642. From when I was 12-17, I attended The King's School in Grantham, up until my mother took me away and tried to make me into a farmer! What a waste that would've been. If it weren't for Henry Stokes, one of my teachers, the very basis of modern science would not exist, for I'd be too busy milking cows!
					<br /><br />Although I didn't seem like anyone overly special during my college years, they were some of the most productive years of my life, or anyone's for that matter! I discovered the binomial theorum in 1665, and it was only uphill from there. In just two years, I developed theories on calculus, on optics, and the law of gravitation we all know and love.

				<h3>PERSONAL LIFE</h3>

				<p>
					It's undeniably hard to balance work and life, especially when work is what I dedicate my life towards! I've never married, but I do have a very close friendship with Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, a fellow mathematician.
					<br /><br />Even while being exceptionally organized, I couldn't help but doodle as well. Why not sprinkle my intellectual genius with some creative genius too? My dorm room at Grantham had walls plastered with drawings of birds, monsters, men and ships, along with some math equations sprinkled about.
					<br /><br />Aside from that, my life has been almost entirely dedicated to science.
